# wildfire
Project 1 - Code for wildfire project in hackathon club

Since github pages does not support server-sided files such as php and nodejs, the only way to have a database is externally, so my json is hosted externally. 

The page json.html exists for developers to view the json when testing.

The page cleardb.html exists to clear the json database while testing.

The js file script.js has no current functionality, but it does contain some functions that may be useful for any additional changes. The current functions are relating to finding driving distance between two addresses and/or coordinates.

The map is created through a free map api called Leaflet (https://leafletjs.com/). The map layers are imported from google maps. 

Public css and javascript libraries are used such as Jquery, normalize.css, bootstrap.css, iconscout unicons.

Please ask developers for any further questions.
